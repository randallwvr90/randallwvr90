## About me
I'm a data analyst with 9 years of experience in the field of mechanical engineering. I have had positions in custom order design, new product development, and manufacturing / process improvement. After deciding on a career change, I recently completed a six-month data analysis and visualization course and am now looking for my first opportunity!<br><br>
While you're here, take a look through my portfolio! I have made public a few of my projects, showcasing my work in various aspects of data analysis and visualization.<br><br>
In my spare time, I'm also a fine art photographer. If you'd like to see my photography work, check out my website at the link below!<br><br>
